### Schneier: Applied Cryptography
* Public-key cryptography: It uses two keys, one public and one private. The public key encrypts the message, and the private key decrypts it. It solves the problem of symmetric cryptosystems where you need to share the key beforehand.
* Hybrid cryptosystem: A session key is used to encrypt the communication on top of the public-key encryption to prevent attacks.
* Merkle's puzzle: This enables secure communication over insecure channels by creating puzzles that are easier for the intended parties to solve than for an eavesdropper, making interception impractically difficult for an attacker.
* Arbitreator digital signatures: There is a middle man and people must send messages through him and he has a sertification that it passed in each message. He has to be 100% trusted or the whole method will fail seriously.
* Public-key signatures: The normal public-key encryption can be used and no middleman is needed. A timestamp is a way to secure that they signature is not reused. Hashes are even better way to secure authenticity of a signature and that it is not used second time.
