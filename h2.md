## x) Summaries
### Schneier: Applied Cryptography
* Public-key cryptography: It uses two keys, one public and one private. The public key encrypts the message, and the private key decrypts it. It solves the problem of symmetric cryptosystems where you need to share the key beforehand.
* Hybrid cryptosystem: A session key is used to encrypt the communication on top of the public-key encryption to prevent attacks.
* Merkle's puzzle: This enables secure communication over insecure channels by creating puzzles that are easier for the intended parties to solve than for an eavesdropper, making interception impractically difficult for an attacker.
* Arbitreator digital signatures: There is a middle man and people must send messages through him and he has a sertification that it passed in each message. He has to be 100% trusted or the whole method will fail seriously.
* Public-key signatures: The normal public-key encryption can be used and no middleman is needed. A timestamp is a way to secure that they signature is not reused. Hashes are even better way to secure authenticity of a signature and that it is not used second time.
* Digital encryption on signature operation need to use different keys to enhance security and so outsiders cannot decrypt messages that are not intended for them. Key Certification Authority is used to make it more difficult for outsiders to decrypt messages.
* Random-number generators are not usually safe enough to be used in cryptography even if they are useful in other things. The chapter gives three properties that the generator needs to pass: 1) looks random, 2) is unpredictable and 3) cannot be reproduced.
* I found this very interesting but also quite challenging read. I had to read some of the text couple of times to understand it. It was good that it had concrete examples to demonstrate different situations.

### Rosenbaum: Grokking Bitcoin
* More detailed text about signatures than the previous one, especially about signing messages.
* Signing can help prevent people from pretending to be someone else.
* Public key cannot be derived from the private key.
* Signatures are usually encrypted with your own private key so anyone with your public key can decrypt them.
* Bitcoin uses hashed signatures.
* Keep your private key safe (obviously). Otherwise people can send messages that are signed as you.
* I like this text and the pictures made it easy to understand.

### Karvinen: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
* PGP Encryption: PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption ensures that messages sent over the internet remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access.
* GPG (GNU Privacy Guard): A popular encryption tool that uses public-key cryptography to secure data and communications.
* This text shows how to send a secret message through internet.
* First step is to generate the keypair (public and private)
* Second step is to send the public key to the receiver.
* Third step is when the receiver gets the public key.
* Fourth, the sender encyrpts and signs the message. Then she sends it.
* Fifth, the receiver decryps the message and verfies the signature.
* How I used this text to send a message is explained in detail in task b.

## a) Pubkey today  
### WhatsApp
<p>I use this app to chat with my friends. WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption system and Signal protocol.</p>

* Parties involved: Me, a friend, WhatAapp
* Key generation: When I register my device (like mobile phone) WhatsApp generates a pair of keys: a public and a private key. This is called and Identity Key Pair (page 5).
* Exchanging a message: A Session is setup. A Message Key is generated for each message. Message Key is derived from my Chain Key. Chain Key is derived from Root Key (page 4, 13-15).

## b) Messaging
<p>I used the instructions by Karvinen to send the message.</p>

* Step 1: Installed necessary tools
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5aadabb4-a91a-480e-98d8-1c2526963d97)

* Step 2: Created key pair
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c5a5c2-40ff-43b0-a313-ca0f412be572)

* Step 3: Checked my public key (first 4 rows)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07a5cb8d-fa2b-4181-95d0-4f953de85313)

* Step 4: Created Alice's keyring and keypair
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f389b9b2-aeb0-48c9-83af-10a65a9d893d)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e1b06c-e30c-4d4c-a686-5802a23c109c)

* Step 5: Imported my public key to Alice's keyring
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67425430-debc-4609-bd4b-368c20af27ab)

* Step 6: Signed and checked Juuso's public key
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf55ff38-52a4-4ca2-851b-d95b918e3bd2)

* Step 7: As myself I trusted Alice's public key
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa45bc18-fec6-4287-96b3-aeeff63e8410)

* Step 8: Alice wrote a message and encrypted it
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d400c8e1-5fdb-4be4-9907-8906b179e12c)

* Step 9: Copied the file to my own directory and then decrypted it

## c) Other tool, Advanced Ecryption Standard (AES)
<p></p>

## d) Eve and Mallory
### Protection againgts Eve the eavesdropper
* The overall encryption helps to fight against Mallory. When the message is encrypted it is not readible without decrypting. Encryption is done with parameter --encrypt.

## f) Password management
<p>I use Microsoft Authenticator myself a lot. It is on my mobile phone and works for passwords and authentication codes. It is convinient as it is always with me.</p>
Reasons to use password management:
* You can have very difficult passwords and different for every site, app or service. People who need to remember them by heart usually have same or similar passwords. Can be used to attack multiple services if your password is leaked.
* No need to write passwords down and keep them under your keyboard. Your password can be stolen.
* Password manager can spot phishing sites.
* Sometimes people like to share passwords. Some managers let you do this safely.
