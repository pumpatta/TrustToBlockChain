## Summaries

<p>These summaries are from the HelSec November 2024 Meetup presentations which were streamed through Twitch. The schedule is below.</p>
The event schedule: https://events.helsec.fi/helsec/nvmbr/

### Presentation 1, Jos Helmich - Industrial Cyber Security

* The presentation was shorter than I expected. I also thought that he would talk in a more concrete way about how cyber security is applied in the industrial field, as the presenter works for Konecranes. He spoke more about legislation and standards.
* The presentation concentrated on legislation and standards that apply to cyber security in general.
* Both European and US legislation have to be followed, which can be quite challenging. Especially US legislation can change every four years when the government changes.
* Helmich brought up two important standards that concern cyber security: NIS-2 and CRA.
* NIS-2 is an EU directive. Availability, integrity, and confidentiality are principles in this directive. Availability means that systems are operational when needed. Integrity means that data is accurate and secure. Confidentiality means that sensitive data is protected.
* CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) is another EU directive. This is more of a product-specific directive, while NIS-2 is more of an organization-level directive.
* Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important, and the EU has an AI act coming soon. This is a modular approach with product safety, GDPR, and cyber resilience as modules.
* The European Union appears to be a leading player in cybersecurity regulation. This raises the question of whether such extensive regulations could be a disadvantage for European industries by creating barriers for smaller and growing organizations or whether they ultimately benefit citizens and organizations by providing greater protection. Larger companies may find it easier to comply with these standards, potentially giving them a competitive advantage.

### Presentation 2, Heikki Juva - State of Union

* Juva's presentation was the jewel of this event. It was also about standards and how different products are compatible with them.
* CRA was introduced here as well, but another standard Juva mentioned was RED (Radio Equipment Directive). These devices can be anything that transmits information, such as baby monitors, various sensors, Wi-Fi routers, or Bluetooth speakers.
* For CRA compliance, they had four questions regarding what the device can do and how it handles these aspects:
* Are software updates enforced?
  * Is the storage unit secure?
  * Are there vulnerabilities?
  * Are passwords unique and strong?
* For RED compliance, there were another four key questions:
  * How good is the documentation regarding user privacy?
  * Are users notified if protection or privacy settings are changed?
  * Does a third party have access to personal information?
  * Can the user or an authorized party delete all private information (right to be forgotten)?
    
* Juva and his team tested devices worth â‚¬10,000 to evaluate compliance with these regulations. His example was a baby monitor, which did not perform well in these tests. The only positive aspect was that users were forced to update the equipment. However, the device also:
  * Used insecure data storage,
  * Relied on hard-coded and simple passwords, and
  * Stripped users of practically all rights to their data.
* This was very eye-opening, showing how manufacturers sell products without providing consumers with a clear understanding of their security or data handling practices. Regulators should address this by enforcing compliance and requiring simple, clear answers to key questions about security and privacy on product packaging. This would allow consumers to easily compare products and make informed decisions.
