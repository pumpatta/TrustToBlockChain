# Homework 1 - Adversarial mindset
### Kill Chains
* Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): long-term multi-step threat, usually large organization like a state behind the operation.
* Intelligence-driver computer network defence: a strategy how to fight against APT.
* Intrusion Kill chain is a 7 step model how these threats progress and try to intrude.
* Actions to fight against: Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy
* Campaign Analysis: Analysing multiple campaigns defenders can find patterns and similarities and use these findings for defense.

### Darknet diaries - EP 148: Dubsnatch
* The episode is about music enthusiasts who hack to music labels' storages to steal unpublished music (an other stuff)
* They did not need anything fancy and almost anyone could do these hacks. They just needed some old leaked passwords and used them to different sites.
* It is scary how unsecure cloud storage services are (like box.com and DropBox). People share these folders to collaborate but outsiders can use these to extract data easily.
* Even though these teenagers (14-15 years old at the time) were only interested in music files, they found also other files that hand more meaningful monetary value.
* Lessons learned: 1) ALWAYS use different passwords for each site. Not just one letter different but really another password. 2) Don't share links in Dropbox. 3) Minor break can lead to something much bigger. 4) Never trust people you collaborate with. Their security may not be at the same level as yours.
