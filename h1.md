## X - Summaries
### Kill Chains
* Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): long-term multi-step threat, usually large organization like a state behind the operation.
* Intelligence-driver computer network defence: a strategy how to fight against APT.
* Intrusion Kill chain is a 7 step model how these threats progress and try to intrude.
* Actions to fight against: Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy
* Campaign Analysis: Analysing multiple campaigns defenders can find patterns and similarities and use these findings for defense.
* We discussed about the cost ratio during the previous class. It would be interesting to know how much orgnizations are actually interested in preventing serious threats. How these cost analyses are estimated?

### Darknet diaries - EP 148: Dubsnatch
* The episode is about music enthusiasts who hack to music labels' storages to steal unpublished music (an other stuff)
* They did not need anything fancy and almost anyone could do these hacks. They just needed some old leaked passwords and used them to different sites.
* It is scary how unsecure cloud storage services are (like box.com and DropBox). People share these folders to collaborate but outsiders can use these to extract data easily.
* Even though these teenagers (14-15 years old at the time) were only interested in music files, they found also other files that hand more meaningful monetary value.
* Lessons learned: 1) ALWAYS use different passwords for each site. Not just one letter different but really another password. 2) Don't share links in Dropbox. 3) Minor break can lead to something much bigger. 4) Never trust people you collaborate with. Their security may not be at the same level as yours.

### ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix
* Tactic: This answers the question of why attackers are taking a particular approach. For example, Execution is a tactic, representing the adversaryâ€™s objective to run malicious code on a target system. Running this code might help them achieve further goals, such as privilege escalation to gain admin rights.
* Technique: This explains how an attacker carries out the tactic. For the Execution tactic, PowerShell is one technique that attackers often use. They might use PowerShell scripts to run commands that elevate user rights or perform other privileged actions.
* Procedure: This is the specific implementation of a technique. For example, ADDInternals is a procedure within the PowerShell technique used for administering Azure Active Directory and could be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes.

## A) Difference between Cyber Kill Chain and ATT&CK matrix
<p>ATT&CK provides more detail and covers more steps than the Cyber Kill Chain, which serves as a high-level overview for defending against serious threats. The Kill Chain is ideal for explaining the progression of attacks to a general audience, while ATT&CK is more practical for professionals who need to address specific adversary techniques and tactics.</p>

## B) Security indicent: 
<p>I listened to a Darknet Diaries episode about music enthusiasts trying to find unreleased music.</p>

* Threat actor: Young music enthusiast "Professor Dubstep" and his friends, who were interested in accessing unreleased music files.
* Exploit: They exploited a vulnerability in the URL shortener Bitly, by adding a "+" sign to the end of a shortened link, they could view all links ever shortened by that account.
* Vulnerability: This incident could result in financial losses and damage to reputations, as unreleased music was made public before its official launch. For instance, one album was leaked, which not only affected the artist's sales potential but also disrupted marketing strategies.
* Business impact: This incident could result in financial losses and damage to reputations, as unreleased music was made public before its official launch. For instance, one album was leaked, which not only affected the artist's sales potential but also disrupted marketing strategies.
