# h3 Hash

## Summaries
### Protocol Building Blocks
* One-way functions: It is difficult (takes millions of years) to reverse the code if you know the function.
* It can be difficult to know if a function is a difficult to crack one-way function.
* Trapdoor on-way fuctions: One-way function with a secret trapdoor. If I know this secret I can reverse it.
* One-way hash function: Converts any string (called pre-image) to a fixed length string. This is used to sign/fingerprint the original. This is a one-way function because you cannot reverse the has back to the pre-image.
* Collision-free hash function: Technically your could have two different pre-images with the same hash but that is also very unlikely if you have a good hash function.
* Message authentiction code (MAC): One-way hash function but the hash is only verifiable by someone who knows the secret key as in normal case the hash is open and public.

### Cracking Password with Hashcat
* User passwords are kept as hashes in databases. It is illegal to store passwords as they are.
* This article shows how to crack a password with a program called hashcat.
* More detailed information is in the task C where I install Hashcat and use it to crack the hash.

## A) Billion dollar busywork
<p>It is impossible to know what the string would be so that 0 is in the front. This is because as explained previously the hash is one way. If I knew what letters I need to write for the pre-image to get a certain hash I could then reverse it. Therefore I used brute force to get the first digit to be 0.</p>

<p>Bitcoin uses this as a proof-of-work mechanism. Since hashes cannot be reversed, miners can trust that the block is secure and valid. Miners search for a hash with a specific number of leading zeroes (more than just one as I tested), and the difficulty increases over time as more miners compete to solve it, keeping block times consistent.</p>

## B) Compare hash
<p>STEP 1) I created a text file and wrote text "Hello world".</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4bb7177-349c-426b-a8d0-1ee161b64e5f)

<p>The hash is:</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d9d9332-f1aa-4277-afa5-818b487dc3a9)

<p>STEP 2) I added an exclamation mark to the text and the hashing function generated a completely new hash.</p>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bcf3343-fe81-4067-9fa7-ba54083145cb)

<p>STEP 3) I also removed the exclamation mark again to verify that the hash is same as it was in the beginning.</p>

## C) Hashcat
<p>I followed the instructions from "Cracking Password with Hashcat".</p>
* STEP 1) Installed Hashcat:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f0be481-7e7a-4517-8fe4-da2f800d25e4)

* STEP 2) Created a folder for the homework and installed rockyou dictionary. Now I have a very large text file in my folder. The text file contains over 14 million words used as passwords.

* STEP 3) Checking possible hash function used for hash `6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d770657e-3d63-494a-9005-16a4b7308ce6)

* STEP 4) Trying a common MD5 hash function. Cracked the hash in about 25 seconds. The password is `summer`

## D) Dictionary attack
<p>Now I try to crack a hash <code>21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3</code> with Hashcat and rockyou.txt dictionary as in the previous task.</p>

* STEP 1) Analysing which hash function is used with command `hashid -m 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d100bf13-db0f-4dea-9eed-1bcd6fbd1561)

* STEP 2) I try MD5 first as in the previous task with command `hashcat -m 0 '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3' rockyou.txt -o solved1`

* STEP 3) Cracked it and saved the password to file solved1. The password is `admin`. Not very secure!

## E) How to make a password against dictionary attack
Dictionary attacks use brute-force while using predifined word lists of common passwords and their variations. Attackers can also generate a dictionary if they know one of your passwords. They can try these variations for multiple services. Here are some measures to take against dictionary attacks:

* Use unique password that does not mean anything and has quite random letters, characters and numbers. 'P4ssw0rd123!!' is <b>not</b> one. F@3#hJ9*k1 is more secure. The longer the random password is, the more secure it is.
* Use Multi-factor authentication. It means that you need a specific device and/or fingerprint along with the password.
* Limit password attempts within a period of time.
* Include captchas (those I'm not a robot checks).
* Use a password manager.
* Do not use same password or its variations for different services.

## F) Two minute job (VOLUNTARY)
<p>This is similar to tasks C & D and I try the same method with Hashcat.</p>

* STEP 1) I tried to identify which function is used but there hash has some separators that cuts the has and gives me an error.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12aba04d-1ae4-4772-a068-0ac009d16a55)

* STEP 2) I google how to fix this and I need to make a txt file where I put the has. I have hashes.txt and only string is the hash. I still get 'unknown hash'.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a74c9f68-0d30-41d7-a378-f40552c352e8)

* STEP 3) I know from the task that bcrypt function is used to I check Hashcat's documentation which hash mode is used with bcrypt which is 3200. So the command is: `hashcat -m 3200 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -o solved2`. This uses the same rockyou dictionary and saves the password to solved2 file. And it cracks the password which is `12345`. Again not very secure.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebb3ea4-cd9c-4e58-b96b-961a6b2c836f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656ac196-1bde-4083-8852-9ec06b7e31b7)

* STEP 4) Hashrate: 0 H/s (5.71ms) @ Accel:2 Loops:64 Thr:1 Vec:1. Looks like it does not do anything because hash rate is 0 H/s. I am not quite sure if I got the right answer (12345). Or maybe it is because it was so simple password. It is the second password in the whole txt file and it practically didn't take any time to crack the hash.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f22208f-2668-436a-8498-e643c9087c4e)

* STEP 5) I decided to test with some other password. I checked the 100 000th password in the rockyou.txt list and found `sagar`. I used an internet site Bcrypt-Generator to get the hash of the password: `$2a$04$ZAfWay99ACTXnc1CPGoCK.h6cRLmvtKubcYNbYB2sZ8a3z/SJvY2C`. I used a net site to hash it and the decrypted it with same command as in STEP 3. Now I got some speed. My virtual machine can run 2353 hashes per second and it takes 1.48 milliseconds to compute one hash.

## G) Where do you want to go today? (VOLUNTARY BONUS)
I used Hashcat like in the previous assignents and now I just use another hash mode. I used command: 'hashcat -m 1000 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -o solved5'. The password is 'monkey'. Not sure if this is the right one. I was expecting a location because the title of the task implies so.

## I & K) Installing John & Crack file password with John
<p>Installed with the teacher's instructions.</p>

* STEP 1) Installed libaries needed. I had to modify the command a bit because it said it could not find zlib-gst as was instructed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2689a1d3-e9b3-402e-a85c-e11038d36e82)

* STEP 2) Get Jumbo code from github. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c66157cc-b84a-4292-9bef-816d1ef77ee9)

* STEP 3) Configured and compiled. Not sure if I have everything because I could not install that one library. Also got some warning while compiling.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05b964c-bd2a-4c5a-a012-4e4067ecc796)

* STEP 4)  Run
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b738afd-eaf6-4775-bd88-1dd755c1507c)

* STEP 5) Get the password protected file and tried to open it:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3cbc44-9a86-498b-b577-9a7906e24b39)

* STEP 6) Extracted the hash to a new file called `tero.zip.hash`. Then I did a dictionary attack to that hash file. You can see the password in the line that is in brown. Password: `butterfly`.
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc112df3-fe0b-4f6b-b9e5-7321ef9bfb17)

* STEP 7) Now I can unzip the file with correct password.
