# h3 Hash
## Summaries
### Protocol Building Blocks
* One-way functions: It is difficult (takes millions of years) to reverse the code if you know the function.
* It can be difficult to know if a function is a difficult to crack one-way function.
* They are not very good in cryptography because decyrpting these would be almost impossible.
* Therefore there are tradoor on-way fuctions: One-way function with a secret trapdoor. If I know this secret I can reverse it.
* One-way hash function: Converts any string (called pre-image) to a fixed length string. This is used to sign/fingerprint the original. This is a one-way function because you cannot reverse the has back to the pre-image.
* Collision-free hash function: Technically your could have two different pre-images with the same hash but that is also very unlikely if you have a good hash function.
* Message authentiction code (MAC): One-way hash function but the hash is only verifiable by someone who knows the secret key as in normal case the hash is open and public.

### Cracking Password with Hashcat
* User passwords are kept as hashes in databases. It is illegal to store passwords as they are.
* This article shows how to crack a password with a program called hashcat.
* More detailed information is in the task C where I install Hashcat and use it to crack the hash.
