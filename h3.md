## Summaries
### Protocol Building Blocks
* One-way functions: It is difficult (takes millions of years) to reverse the code if you know the function.
* It can be difficult to know if a function is a difficult to crack one-way function.
* They are not very good in cryptography because decyrpting these would be almost impossible.
* Therefore there are tradoor on-way fuctions: One-way function with a secret trapdoor. If I know this secret I can reverse it.
* One-way hash function: Converts any string (called pre-image) to a fixed length string. This is used to sign/fingerprint the original. This is a one-way function because you cannot reverse the has back to the pre-image.
* Collision-free hash function: Technically your could have two different pre-images with the same hash but that is also very unlikely if you have a good hash function.
* Message authentiction code (MAC): One-way hash function but the hash is only verifiable by someone who knows the secret key as in normal case the hash is open and public.

### Cracking Password with Hashcat
* User passwords are kept as hashes in databases. It is illegal to store passwords as they are.
* This article shows how to crack a password with a program called hashcat.
* More detailed information is in the task C where I install Hashcat and use it to crack the hash.

## A) Billion dollar busywork
<p>It is impossible to know what the string would be so that 0 is in the front. This is because as explained previously the hash is one way. If I knew what letters I need to write for the pre-image to get a certain hash I could then reverse it. Therefore I used brute force to get the first digit to be 0.</p>

<p>Bitcoin uses this as a proof-of-work mechanism. Since hashes cannot be reversed, miners can trust that the block is secure and valid. Miners search for a hash with a specific number of leading zeroes (more than just one as I tested), and the difficulty increases over time as more miners compete to solve it, keeping block times consistent.</p>

## B) Compare hash
<p>I created a text file and wrote text "Hello world".</p>

<p>The hash is:</p>

<p>I added an exclamation mark to the text and the hashing function generated a completely new hash.</p>

<p>I also removed the exclamation mark again to verify that the hash is same as it was in the beginning.</p>
