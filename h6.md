## X) Summaries

### Tor: Design goals and assumptions
* Deployability: The design must be practical for real-world deployment, avoiding high costs, heavy liability burdens, and complex implementations. It should not require non-anonymous parties to run special software.
* Usability: The system should be easy to use, requiring minimal configuration and not introducing significant delays. It should be compatible with common platforms without requiring users to change their operating systems. This gives security and strenghten anonymity.
* Flexibility: The protocol should be adaptable and well-specified, allowing it to serve as a test-bed for future research and improvements in low-latency anonymity networks.
* Simple Design: The design should be straightforward and well-understood, avoiding unnecessary complexity and unproven techniques to ensure deployability, readability, and ease of security analysis.

### De-anonymisation attacks on tor
* Governments are polica are interested to de-anonymise Tor and other anynmous networks because they can be used for illegal or anti-govermental activities.
