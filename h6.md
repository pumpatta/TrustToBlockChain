## X) Summaries

### Tor: Design goals and assumptions
* Deployability: The design must be practical for real-world deployment, avoiding high costs, heavy liability burdens, and complex implementations. It should not require non-anonymous parties to run special software.
* Usability: The system should be easy to use, requiring minimal configuration and not introducing significant delays. It should be compatible with common platforms without requiring users to change their operating systems. This gives security and strenghten anonymity.
* Flexibility: The protocol should be adaptable and well-specified, allowing it to serve as a test-bed for future research and improvements in low-latency anonymity networks.
* Simple Design: The design should be straightforward and well-understood, avoiding unnecessary complexity and unproven techniques to ensure deployability, readability, and ease of security analysis.

### De-anonymisation attacks on tor
* Governments and law enforcement agencies seek to de-anonymize Tor and other anonymous networks due to their potential use for illegal or anti-government activities.
* Anonymity is essential not only for criminals but also for whistleblowers, journalists, and activists.
* Tor stands for "The Onion Router," the most widely used anonymous network.
* This paper categorizes different types of de-anonymization attacks; Fig. 6 illustrates these attack types and references related articles.
* Architecture: Tor operates by routing traffic through multiple relays (entry, middle, and exit nodes), each decrypting a layer of encryption, ensuring no single node knows both the source and destination.
* Hidden services (or onion services): Enable websites to maintain anonymity, protecting both the server and users.
* This was quite a technical paper so not sure if I understood everything. I think the most important thing is that the user and also sites can be made anonymous.

### PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB
* The video demonstrates how PhishSticks can be used to compromise a user's computer.
* A keylogger was installed via the USB stick, enabling the attacker to monitor everything the user does on their computer.
* The compromised system sends captured information back to the hacker.
* Key takeaway:  Never use an unknown USB stick! I recall a time when USB sticks were often used to share files, such as PowerPoint presentations at press events. While Iâ€™m not sure how common these attacks are today, the lesson remains relevant.

## C) Onion
* Onion Routing: Tor uses a technique called onion routing, where data is encapsulated in multiple layers of encryption, similar to the layers of an onion. Each layer is peeled off by a different node in the network, revealing the next destination.
* Public Keys and Encryption: Tor uses public key cryptography to establish secure connections between nodes. Each node has a long-term identity key and a short-term onion key. The identity key is used for signing, while the onion key is used for decrypting requests to set up circuits.
* Session Keys: When a circuit is established, the initiator (client) negotiates session keys with each node in the circuit using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. These session keys are used for symmetric encryption of data as it passes through the circuit.
* Perfect Forward Secrecy: Tor ensures perfect forward secrecy by using ephemeral keys for each session. This means that even if a key is compromised, it cannot be used to decrypt past communications.
* Encryption Algorithms: Tor uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in counter mode for encrypting data. This ensures that each layer of encryption is independent and secure.
* Circuit Construction: The client incrementally builds a circuit by extending it one hop at a time. Each node only knows its predecessor and successor, but not the entire path, ensuring that no single node can trace the entire communication route.

## D) Threat models
* Global adversary: This model assumes that the adversary has the capability to monitor a significant portion of the internet traffic, both entering and exiting the Tor network. This could include entities like nation-states or large ISPs.
* Capturing entry flow: This threat model involves an adversary who can observe the traffic entering the Tor network. This could be a network administrator, an Internet Service Provider (ISP), or any entity with the capability to monitor the user's connection to the Tor network.
* Compromising Tor nodes: This model assumes that the adversary can control or compromise certain nodes within the Tor network. By doing so, they can observe and manipulate traffic to identify users or hidden services.

## E) PhishSticks
* How they work: PhishSticks attacks use malicious USB devices that emulate human interface devices, such as keyboards, to inject preprogrammed commands or scripts. Once connected, these devices can execute commands, install malware, or exfiltrate sensitive data without user awareness.
* Who are vulnerable: Organizations with untrained employees and insufficient USB port security controls.
* Broader perspective: This attack falls under threats that exploit human trust and reliance on seemingly harmless devices.
* Mitigation: Educate users, enforce USB usage policies, and implement endpoint security solutions.
