## X) Summaries

### Tor: Design goals and assumptions
* Deployability: The design must be practical for real-world deployment, avoiding high costs, heavy liability burdens, and complex implementations. It should not require non-anonymous parties to run special software.
* Usability: The system should be easy to use, requiring minimal configuration and not introducing significant delays. It should be compatible with common platforms without requiring users to change their operating systems. This gives security and strenghten anonymity.
* Flexibility: The protocol should be adaptable and well-specified, allowing it to serve as a test-bed for future research and improvements in low-latency anonymity networks.
* Simple Design: The design should be straightforward and well-understood, avoiding unnecessary complexity and unproven techniques to ensure deployability, readability, and ease of security analysis.

### De-anonymisation attacks on tor
* Governments and law enforcement agencies seek to de-anonymize Tor and other anonymous networks due to their potential use for illegal or anti-government activities.
* Anonymity is essential not only for criminals but also for whistleblowers, journalists, and activists.
* Tor stands for "The Onion Router," the most widely used anonymous network.
* This paper categorizes different types of de-anonymization attacks; Fig. 6 illustrates these attack types and references related articles.
* Architecture: Tor operates by routing traffic through multiple relays (entry, middle, and exit nodes), each decrypting a layer of encryption, ensuring no single node knows both the source and destination.
* Hidden services (or onion services): Enable websites to maintain anonymity, protecting both the server and users.
* This was quite a technical paper so not sure if I understood everything. I think the most important thing is that the user and also sites can be made anonymous.

### PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB
* The video demonstrates how PhishSticks can be used to compromise a user's computer.
* A keylogger was installed via the USB stick, enabling the attacker to monitor everything the user does on their computer.
* The compromised system sends captured information back to the hacker.
* Key takeaway:  Never use an unknown USB stick! I recall a time when USB sticks were often used to share files, such as PowerPoint presentations at press events. While Iâ€™m not sure how common these attacks are today, the lesson remains relevant.
