## X) Summary
### Bitcoin

* Peer-to-peer electronic transaction: Money is transferred directly between to sides. No banks needed. This is just like cash but in electronic form.
* This still needs some sort of system to be functional and trusted by all parties. Digital signature is the solution.
* All transactions are publicly known to avoid double using the digital currency.
* Proof-of-Work: A system where miners expend computational effort to find a hash with a specified number of leading zeros by incrementing a nonce, securing the blockchain by making it computationally infeasible to alter past blocks without redoing all subsequent work.
* The first transaction of a new block contains a new coin to give incentive to nodes to validate the chain.
* Privacy: users only have their public key known. Of course if someone knows who is behind this then the identity is also revealed.
* I don't personally think that Bitcoin or similar currencies are necessary at all. Especially if they consume a lot of energy without doing anything meaningful with that.

## F) RogeCoin
<p>This is a comedy video about an imaginary cryptocurrency called RogeCoin. </p>
* Statement 1: Easier to lose.
  * I think this is true. If you lose your wallet password, you cannot access your cryptocurrency. I think it is much more difficult to "lose" money or stocks that you own in real life. There is an actual story about a Bitcoin millionaire who cannot access his fortune because he does not remember his password. You could also have your crypto in a crypto exchange. There has been a very serious case where people lost millions of euros worth of cryptos (FTX). This could happen with ordinary banks as well, but they are usually backed by governments.
* Statement 2: More volatile than ordinary currencies.
  * This is also true. As it is not regulated and very speculative, cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile than major currencies like the dollar and the euro. Cryptos' value is determined solely by demand and supply without any regulation. Also, Bitcoin has a limited supply, unlike real money, which governments can print more of if needed. This leads to greater price fluctuation. Ordinary currencies also have a larger market size, which reduces volatility.
* Statement 3: Slaughters environment. Uses more electricity than Switzerland.
  * Bitcoin uses 141–160 Terawatt hours of electricity annually. That is about 0.6–0.7% of the world's total electricity consumption. I'm not sure how much electricity Switzerland uses, but according to the article, it is roughly the same as New York State. This sounds like quite a lot just to keep a currency alive. Cryptos that use proof-of-stake (Ethereum) instead of proof-of-work (Bitcoin) consume much less electricity. Ethereum uses 2,600 Megawatt hours, which is 200 times less than Netflix. So, cryptocurrencies differ significantly in electricity consumption.
* Statement 4: Cannot be exchanged to most goods other than drugs or NFTs.
  * Most shops do not accept Bitcoin and other cryptos as a payment method. However, there are some companies that let you exchange crypto for cash and then buy what you want. I found one service called BitPay. It allows you to have a debit card that uses your crypto and to pay bills. But this still means that you have to convert your crypto into a real currency accepted in your country.
* Statement 5: Cryptocurrencies will keep their values when governments collapse.
 * I just want to say that I hope to live in a world where governments do not collapse, and I find this scenario very unlikely. Maybe in some more unstable countries, the local currency can be very volatile, such as those experiencing hyperinflation. But then again, you have other options like gold and other currencies to invest in if you are worried about losing your money.
* Statement 6: It is an investment because the value will rise.
  * This is somewhat true in the case of Bitcoin. It is currently at its highest value of all time. But, as mentioned earlier, it is also quite volatile. There are also some cryptos that have lost all their value.
