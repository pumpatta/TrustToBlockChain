## X) Summary
### Bitcoin

* Peer-to-peer electronic transaction: Money is transferred directly between to sides. No banks needed. This is just like cash but in electronic form.
* This still needs some sort of system to be functional and trusted by all parties. Digital signature is the solution.
* All transactions are publicly known to avoid double using the digital currency.
* Proof-of-Work: A system where miners expend computational effort to find a hash with a specified number of leading zeros by incrementing a nonce, securing the blockchain by making it computationally infeasible to alter past blocks without redoing all subsequent work.
* The first transaction of a new block contains a new coin to give incentive to nodes to validate the chain.
* Privacy: users only have their public key known. Of course if someone knows who is behind this then the identity is also revealed.
* I don't personally think that Bitcoin or similar currencies are necessary at all. Especially if they consume a lot of energy without doing anything meaningful with that.
