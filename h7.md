## X) Summary

I used Haaga-Helia's library search to find an article. I wanted to find something recent about cloud security. I filtered the results to include only peer-reviewed articles written no earlier than 2022. I found this:

### Dark Clouds on the Horizon? Effects of Cloud Storage on Security Breaches
* The article explores the effects of cloud storage implementation on security breaches. The study investigates short- and long-term impacts on three types of breaches: external, accidental internal and  malicious internal.
* External breaches: Cloud storage increases external breaches in the short term due to misconfiguration and limited initial attention to security. Over time, this effect diminishes, suggesting that organizations adapt their security strategies.
* Accidental internal breaches: A rise in accidental breaches is observed in the early stages of cloud adoption, often linked to negligence during data migration or insufficient training. In the long term, these breaches reduce as cloud platforms provide centralized management, backup, and automation tools, improving security.
* Malicious internal breaches: Cloud adoption shows no significant impact on malicious internal breaches, likely due to improved user activity tracking and authentication protocols inherent to cloud platforms.
* Practical implications:  IT managers should anticipate increased security risks during the initial adoption of cloud storage and allocate resources accordingly. Long-term benefits require continuous improvement in attentional focus and security practices.
